# The Problem

Create a Tic-Tac-Toe checker which takes a complete or semi-complete board and determines the status of the game, e.g. 
* a certain player has won
* the game is a draw
* in progress

You can choose whatever representation of the board, and return type, you like.  E.g.

    "X| |O
     -----
     O|X|O
     -----
     O|X| "
     
       |
       V
 "In Progress"
 
or

 [[1,0,2][2,1,2][2,1,0]] -> 0
 
You can check for a valid board or assume valid inputs, up to you.
